1. Hello! I am Isaac Fenster

2. It was easy setting up my Pi as I have done it before.

3. I have used a raspberry pi for ESE205 and in the WashU Robotics Club.

4. I am somewhat familiar with the linux environment, to the point where I can navigate the basics but understand how much depth I do not yet understand.

5. I have earned an A in a college python course, but I would still rate my python knowledge as a 7. 

6. I have no questions about the upcoming projects. I am excited!
